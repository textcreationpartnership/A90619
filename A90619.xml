         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Promiſed in my laſt, to give you a more full Relation of the Enemies beating up the quarters of our City Horſe at <hi>Oulny</hi> on Saturday morning laſt, about ſeven or eight of the clocke in the morning there came newes of an alarm, and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five hundred of the Enemies Horſe were hard by the Towne. Colonel <hi>Harvey</hi> ſuppoſing that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the report there was no more, made all the ſpeed hee could, and got out ſome troopes to face the Enemy neare the Towneſide, which proved much to our diſadvantage; for if his information had
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:112337:3"/>not beene falſe, he would have quit the Towne up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the approach of the Enemy, and have drawne all his Horſe on this ſide the Bridge, and then the foot to maintaine the Bridge: which, they might have done againſt both the Armies, had they been ioyned together. But when he came forth, he found contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his information, above two thouſand Horſe, foure hundred dragoneers, and a commanded party of muſquetiers, ready to charge thoſe few that were drawne out: which ſtrucke ſuch a terrour in ſome of our newmounted Horſe men, that they faced about and ranne away as faſt as they could with ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, that notwithſtanding all that their Colonels and Captaines could doe or ſay to ſtop them that thus diſordered our foot, and carryed away our men in a throng over the Bridge, and thruſt ſome of them off from the Bridge (for the Bridge and Cauſey was as long as a man might hardly fling a ſtone from end to end) without any railes or wals on either ſide: Colonel <hi>Harvey</hi> and Major <hi>Manwaring</hi> did what they could to ſtay them, inſomuch that (as I heard) Colonel <hi>Harvey</hi> fired upon ſome of our owne men: the Major broke his Piſtoll about their heads, but ſuch was the ſpirit of feare that had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt them that nothing might prevaile. The Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers purſued them into the Towne, where
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:112337:3"/>our poore red coates were put to their ſhifts, being broken before all to pieces by our owne Horſe, that they had no wayes nor meanes to be gotten toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againe. Captaine <hi>May</hi> was amongſt them in the Towne, and they tooke him for one of their owne men, and ſeeing him once neare ſome of our forces, warned him to take heed of the Roundheads: Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Locke</hi> comming over the Bridge, was thruſt off into the water, and the Cavaliers came ſo cloſe after that they fired upon him, and he to ſave himſelfe got under one of the arches of the Bridge, and ſtayed there untill he heard the Cavaliers come powdering backe againe over the Bridge, and thinking hee had heard Captaine <hi>Langham</hi> he came forth, but was no ſooner up in the way, but was demanded who hee was; he anſwered, for King and Parliament, they preſently took him, and one bid prick him forward: he ſmiled upon uhem, ſuppoſing they had beene our owne men, in the meane time Colonel <hi>Harvy</hi> having got together ſome of the ſcattered troopes, made a charge upon them with ſuch violence, that hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them off the Bridge againe. And comming up where Captaine <hi>Locke</hi> was, one of thoſe that had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him was ſhot, the other haſted away, and left Captaine <hi>Locke</hi> to thanke Colonel <hi>Harvey</hi> for his liberty, and ſo got away.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:112337:4"/>
All this while Colonel <hi>Turner,</hi> Captaine <hi>Norwood,</hi> Captaine <hi>Tompſon,</hi> &amp;c. were ſuppoſed to be loſt, and indeed were in much danger, having not above twelve or fifteene men, yet bravely made charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on three Colours of the Enemy, and forced them out of the market place: Colonel <hi>Harvy</hi> came up and cleared the Towne of them, with about forty or fifty Horſe with him: yet the Enemy forced them all backe againe out of the Towne, and drave them all over the Bridge againe, and began to draw up in in the meadow on this ſide the Bridge, where Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Turner</hi> and ſome few of our men were mixed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them upon the Bridge, and durſt not diſcover either to other who they were: for though their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers itched to be doing one with another, yet durſt not ſtirre for feare of falling off the Bridge: at laſt Colonel <hi>Turner</hi> came cleare off without any harme. By this time Colonel <hi>Harvy</hi> had againe gained ſome of his forces, and charged thoſe that were drawn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Bridg ſo violently, that they (to make haſte) fell ſome of them beſides. The Colonel purſued them and cleanſed the Towne and kept it. In this ſervice, both the Colonels, Captaine <hi>Norwood,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Towpſon</hi> performed bravely: but Colonel <hi>Turner</hi> was ſo much troubled to ſee his troopes make ſuch a long wheele, as never all day to come backe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112337:4"/>being lead by his Cornet; that after, neither his owne Cornet, nor any of the Yellow Colours were ſcene in the field, which much diſcouraged him. In the mean time our poore men paid for it, divers of them being ſorely wounded, ſome taken, I cannot heare of above three or foure ſlaine Enſigne <hi>Bartlett</hi> is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, we doubt, taken. Major <hi>Manwaring</hi> through the negligence of his ſervant loſt foure brave Horſes of his owne, and his ſumpters, yet his boy ſaved his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſome clothes: there were ſlaine on both ſides about twenty ſix: ſlaine of Colonel <hi>Harveyes</hi> troope, one, and wounded eight: about twenty five or twenty ſix of our red-coates wounded: ſeven or eight of Captaine <hi>Norwoods</hi> ſlaine. I beleeve the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy hath little cauſe to boaſt of their gaine, which will not make good their loſſe: many of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſorely wounded, above twenty of them were dreſt at a houſe about a mile off, fifteene orſixteene taken, and about as many ſlaine.</p>
